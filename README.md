# Pathfinding-Visualizer
Visualization of A-star Algorithm finding shortest path in a Grid.
This program is written in python using pygame.

It uses heuristics to guarantee the shortest path much faster than Dijkstra's Algorithm.The heuristic function used in this code is Manhattan distance.

# Instructions
Click left button of the mouse to select a cell in grid.

First select the Start loacation and End locations.

Then you can select to place blocks in the cell.

You can reset a particular cell by clicking the right button of the mouse on it.

You can reset the whole grid using 'C' key.

After you are done with selecting start,end locations and placing blocks.You can run the algorithm using 'R' key to find the shortest path between them.
